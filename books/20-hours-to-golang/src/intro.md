# 20 Hours to Go
This is a streamlined course that will help you get started with programming.  The language of choice here is golang.  However, you will probably be able to take what you learn here and move to other languages.  The goal is to give you a pretty good foundation of knowledge so that you can be fairly productive in a short amount of time.

## Why 20 hours?
There's some chatter around that suggests it takes 10,000 hours to get good at something.  The original study that mentioned this determined that several experts in highly competitive fields tend to have put in about 10,000 hours.  This is a high level summary of the studies conclusions, but the reality is, you don't need to be an expert.  After about 20 hours, you can be fairly productive.
Sure, there will probably be plenty more to learn after the 20 hour mark, but cross that bridge when we get there.

## Why Go?
Go prioritizes a simple syntax with minimal keywords.  The language is strongly typed, yet it still provides a level of flexibility.  It provides a nice way to program while reducing ambiguity.

## Course Structure
We will be building several projects.  Each project will try to focus on some fundamentals covered in the course.  There will be moments where you get stuck.  The course community is available to help you through it.  When you are done with a project please do share your experience and help others.
