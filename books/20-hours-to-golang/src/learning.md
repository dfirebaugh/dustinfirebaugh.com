# How To Learn This Content
> This learning framework is optional.  You will need to explore what works best for you.  This framework is given as a suggestion.

### High-level explanation

The course will provide a high level explanation (i.e. the basics).

This is a brief overview of the topic being studied that helps provide context and a general understanding of what will be learned.

You don't have to have a thorough understand of this content on first pass.  The concepts will become more clear as you progress.

(examples of how to apply the concept will be included)

### Expanded Explanation

The expanded section will provide details and more advanced tips for how to operate around the concepts that are taught in the course.

(examples of how to apply the concept will be included)

### Additional Reference

A curated list of external references will be provided.

### Feynman technique

The Feynman Technique (see [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)) involves explaining a concept as if teaching someone else, using simple language and analogies to clarify complex ideas. The Feynman technique is useful for solidifying understanding and identifying gaps in knowledge.

#### Who should you explain to?

* Yourself/Invisible Friend
* Your Pet
* A Friend
* The Course Community

### Practice

The course provides project ideas.  These projects serve as a way for you to apply your newly gained knowledge.

If you build all of the projects, you will have a decent amount of exposure to the concept.

### Measure and Relearn

If you identify a gap in your knowledge, try to be diligent about taking note of that gap. 

* Write down questions that you have in the moment.
* Review the material.
* Ask the course community for direction/help.
* Apply the Feynman technique again by explaining this concept to someone.

After the "relearn", go back to your project with your refreshed understanding.
