## Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton and zero-player game that involves creating patterns on a grid of cells. The simulation starts with a set of initial patterns, known as seeds, and evolves over time based on a set of rules.

### Project Tasks:
* Create a two-dimensional grid to represent the cells in the Game of Life.
* Implement the initial state of the simulation by randomly setting some cells to alive and others to dead.
* Define the rules of the simulation, which determine how the state of each cell evolves over time.
* Update the state of the grid based on the defined rules and display the new state of the grid.
* Repeat step 4 for a set number of iterations or until the simulation reaches a stable state.
