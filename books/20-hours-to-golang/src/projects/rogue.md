## Rogue
In a Rogue-like dungeon crawler the player will navigate through randomly generated levels, fight monsters, loot treasures and try to survive as long as possible.

Project Tasks:
* Generate random levels using procedural generation techniques.
* Define rules for monster behavior and combat system.
* Implement inventory system to allow players to pick up and use items.
* Create user interface with ASCII graphics for displaying the game world.
* Add permadeath feature, so when the player dies, they must start over from the beginning.
