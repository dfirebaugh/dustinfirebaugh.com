## InkBall
InkBall is a puzzle game that involves moving balls to matching colored holes in order to score points.

Project Tasks:
* Create a two-dimensional grid to represent the playing surface for the InkBall game.
* Implement the initial state of the game by randomly placing balls and colored holes onto the grid.
* Define the rules of the game, including how balls move, how they interact with walls and each other, and how they are scored when they reach a matching colored hole.
* Implement user input by allowing the player to select the direction and speed at which the ball should be launched.
* Update the state of the game based on the defined rules and display the new state of the grid.
* If the player scores the required number of points or if all balls have been placed into holes, end the game.
