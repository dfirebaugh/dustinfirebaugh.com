# Projects

Before working on a project, look back at the [Learning Technique](../learning.md) section.

Reach out to the course community if you need assistance or help understanding key concepts or if you have specific questions on how to do something.

You can also post your project in the course community for code review and feedback.

When you feel that you are completed with the project, feel free to post it in the showcase channel.

## Software Is A Team Sport

Learning is your own responsibility.  However, most developers are willing to support another developer's learning endeavors.  

Feel free to group up with others while you work on projects.

## Reviewing Code

You will likely be able to find projects that others have completed.  However, try not to copy pasta the projects together.
