# Setup

Golang is a great cross platform language.

You only need to download one binary and you will be ready to write code.

### Download and install Golang
[https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Follow instructions on how to install golang on your platform.

### Additional Recommended Setup
After installing Go, you can write code in any text editor and compile it at the command line.  However, it is recommended to setup the golang dev tools.  I typically use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the gotools associated with that environment.
