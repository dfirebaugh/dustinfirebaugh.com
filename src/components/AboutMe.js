        Below you will find the best picture ever taken of me. At the time of
        writing, it's probably 5 years old and maybe by the time of you reading
        it will be 10 years old. It's entirely possible that I no longer look
        like the person in that photo. Perhaps I no longer have a face at all.
        Perhaps my fantasies of becoming a linchpin in the human cyborg black
        markets has finally come to fruition -- which might afford me the
        oppurtunity to upload my human consciousness into an electronic vessel
        to live out the rest of time as a form of artificial intelligence.
        Perhaps... Wait, why are we here? ... oh yes, about me...

        I'm a software engineer, button masher, musician, maker/breaker of
        things, technologist, tinkerer, creator, and student of the world. I was
        born in 1988 (you can do the math) and, if I'm lucky, I will live for{' '}
        <strong>{daysTillDeath}</strong> more days. Whoa, I guess I better get
        to work.
