[Makers Unplugged](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/makers-unplugged/id1176260934) was a short run podcast, in 2016, where we sat around and had focused discussions that hovered around weird and interesting makerspace/hackerspace topics.

Aaron and I shared the role of co-host and pulled in several guests to interview until they got tired of us.

One time we even rented a Uhaul for the day and built out a "Pop Up" studio to lure HackRVA members into interviewing.

Shenanigans... Maybe having these focused conversations was just a way for us to relive some of our shenanigans. It ended up being another form of "creating" for us and it helped encourage our culture and community by bringing in others to reflect on their experiences.

I love going back and listening to a few episodes every now and then. One of my favorite episodes is [The tale of the Futile Can Crusher](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/2-the-tale-of-the-futile-can-crusher-project-episode/id1176260934?i=1000378158476). I won't tell the story here, but the video almost speaks for itself.

I also really enjoyed the [Design Thinking](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/9-design-thinking-topic-episode/id1176260934?i=1000382340578) episode where we packed a group of artists into the studio and round table discussed some concepts of art and design.
