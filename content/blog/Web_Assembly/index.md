I made a demo app using Go compiled to Web Assembly. Check it out the repo: [game of life in go wasm](https://github.com/dfirebaugh/game-of-life-wasm)

![game-of-life-gif](./images/game-of-life.gif)

This stuff is exciting!

I'll go over some techincal details about the code first, but feel free to skip ahead to the [High Level on Web Assembly](#High-Level-on-Web-Assembly) section.

## A Look at the code

#### life.go

I attempted to keep this file entirely unrelated to the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) and Web Assembly. It's simply an implementation of game of life. I created an [interface](https://tour.golang.org/methods/9) called a _Renderer_ in hopes that I could eventually create multiple types of renderers (e.g. canvas, terminal, etc...)

The one implementation of Renderer is [dom.go](#dom.go).

#### <a name="dom.go"></a>dom.go

This is where the secret sauce is. If you're only here to look at some code examples, this is probably where you should look.
https://github.com/dfirebaugh/game-of-life-wasm/blob/master/wasm/dom/dom.go

This file makes heavy use of Go's [syscall/js](#syscall/js) library.
This is how we can [manipulate the dom](#Manipulating-the-DOM) with Go.

#### wasm_exec.js

`./client/wasm_util/wasm_exec.js` is provided by Go and can usually be found at
`\$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js`
This is kind of the glue code that helps your javascript communicate with Web Assembly modules written in Go.

It would be nice if this packaged as an npm module. This would allow me to install the "glue code" by simply typing `npm install go-wasm-exec` or something similar.

One of the challenges with this is that this file ships with Go and it's recommened to use the version of that file that corresponds with the Go version that you are using.

I wanted to leave this file unmodified because it was provided by Go.

You'll notice several helper functions that make translating between types in wasm and types in JS. Btw, the only types in web assembly are numbers. So, ints and floats... There are several functions being imported which are used by go's syscall/js package.

This file also handles [loading the wasm file.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiate) If I decided not to use `syscall/js` package from Go, I could have ran this `WebAssembly.intantiate()` function myself and added my own imports. However, I wanted to try to keep things simple for this demo.

#### wasm_loader.js

To leave `wasm_exec.js` unmodified, I decided to import `wasm_exec.js` as an [es module](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) into a new file `wasm_loader.js`.

`wasm_loader.js` is a very small file that only loads the wasm file.

```javascript
import './wasm_exec.js'

const go = new Go()
WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('wasm.wasm'), go.importObject)
  .then(result => {
    go.run(result.instance)
  })
  .catch(console.error)
```

#### server.go

There's nothing special about `server.go`. It's simply a web server that serves up the client and serves up the wasm file.

Note that the wasm file is being served up with a specific MIME type.

```Go
			resp.Header().Set("content-type", "application/wasm")
```

#### <a name="Manipulating-the-DOM"></a>Manipulating the DOM

[Document Object Model - DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)

Manipulating the DOM with Go actually seemed to be a step backwards. It felt similar to the jquery days. Or rather, it felt like managing the DOM with vanilla JS where you do some query selectors and imparatively make changes as needed. As a JS dev, this was fairly simple to pick up because you are calling the same APIs that javascript has access to.

I found that there were some obvious rendering improvements that I could have made by implementing some lazy rendering or diffing to reduce how many times I wrote to the DOM. For this demo, I felt OK with ignoring these improvements. However, that isn't something unique to web assembly. I can see how libraries could make this low effort for us in the future.

I much prefer the declarative nature of something like React/jsx or even standard HTML than having to manually to call `createElement` and similar methods. So, even though I did a lot of DOM manipulation with Go in this app, I can't say I recommend it.

Tools like [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/) make sharing memory/values pretty straight forward, but eventually it will be built into the spec.

#### Shared Memory

> The WebAssembly.Memory object has a [buffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Memory/buffer) property is a resizable [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) that holds the raw bytes of memory accessed by a WebAssembly Instance.
> -- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Memory)

In my demo, I'm not accessing this "memory" directly, but the go package that I'm using is definitely taking advantage of the shared memory buffer.

I would like to explore more with sharing values to JS so that I can use javascript or a library like react to manage the DOM.

#### <a name="syscall/js"></a>syscall/js

[syscall/js](https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/) is a package with several functions that help share data between JS and Go. In my demo, I use it mostly for DOM manipulation. Maybe in my next project I'll explore more with function such as `CopyBytesToJS` which seems to allow you to directly share values from Go to JS.

#### Lessons Learned and Gotchas

I cover this a bit later in [Problems with Go](#Problems-with-Go)

## <a name="High-Level-on-Web-Assembly"></a> High Level on Web Assembly

### What is Web Assembly?

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications
> -- [Web Assembly Home Page](https://webassembly.org/)

The super high level description is that Web Assembly allows us to write code for the web with languages other than Javascript.

There's a bit more to it than that.

[Javascript Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine)(most notably [V8](https://v8.dev/) on Chrome and [Spider Monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) on Firefox ) run on top of a virtual machine in the browser (check out the [history lesson](#Some-Context-and-a-brief-history-lesson) a bit further down). Web Assembly runs on top of this same virtual machine.

The name Web Assembly is a bit of a mislabel because It's not quite [Web](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/) and it's not quite [Assembly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1782415/what-is-the-difference-between-assembly-code-and-bytecode) (it's a bytecode intended to run on a VM -- assembly usually refers to opcodes compiled to something natively executable by machines). Yes, you can compile to target browsers, but there's actually a lot of potential for web assembly running outside the browser. (see further in this writing [Web Assembly Outside of the Web - WASI](#Web-Assembly-Outside-of-the-Web---WASI))

### Will it Replace Javascript?

No. Web Assembly is intended to run along side of Javascript. Allowing you to use Javascript for it's strengths (expressiveness, ease of use, manipulating DOM nodes) while gaining efficiencies of near native speeds and strong typing of other language (e.g. C, C++, Rust, etc...)

### Why do you need to be aware of Web Assembly Today?

Web Assembly (or wasm for short) has paradigm shifting potential that will affect how the web works and how we write software. Even if you're not actively writing code for Web Assembly, frameworks will be taking advantage of web assembly to optimize for performance.

WASM is being created as an open standard by [W3C WebAssembly Community](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/).

WASM was first announced in 2015, and gained first class [support from all major browsers in 2017](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/13/webassembly-in-browsers/). Web Assembly is out today and it's likely that some software (and WebApps) that you use are currently taking advantage of it.

See further [use-cases](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/)

#### Efficient and Fast

> WebAssembly code can be executed at near-native speed across different platforms by taking advantage of common [hardware capabilities](https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/#assumptions-for-efficient-execution).
> -- [Mozilla Developer Wiki](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts)

It's often said that Web Assembly is fast. "Fast" is in reference to how fast it is compared to Javascript. These days [Javascript is amazingly fast](#The-Speed-of-Javascript), but wasm aims to perform at near native speeds.

#### Safe

Web Assembly is built for safety. Being that it runs off of the same VM that javascript uses, it's sandboxed just as javascript is.

Web Assembly will allow the use of mature security and cryptographic libraries that previously limited availability for the web.

#### Security White Papers on Web Assembly:

### The Speed of Javascript

These days, Javascript is blazing fast. However, this wasn't always the case.

[Javascript was written in ten days.](https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module-owner/) Well, the first Javascript Engine Prototype took 10 days. It wasn't built for speed. Speed came later when browsers started implementing [JIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) (Just In Time Compilation) compilers in efforts to increase performance.

With any language there are usually tradeoffs. Javascript has a lot of ease of use and expressiveness. This allows for developers to get up and going quickly with it and allows for rapid prototyping of web apps.

The first JIT compilers in major browsers were implemented in 2008. This allowed browsers to increase the speed of javascript code running on the web making js code almost 10 times faster.

Web Assembly runs on top of the same VMs that these JIT compilers run on and Web Assembly will make the web even faster.

## Programming Web Assembly With Rust

[Programming Web Assembly with Rust](https://pragprog.com/book/khrust/programming-webassembly-with-rust) is an excellent book that walks through several projects to help you learn Web Assembly. It starts out by introducing WAT (Web Assembly Text Format) and then later dives into writing Web Assembly with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) Programming language.

This is a great book if you like learning by doing and it happens to be a decent intro to Rust.

Alternatively, here is an open source free to read book [Rust and Web Assembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/) (Disclaimer - I have not read the "Rust and Web Assembly" book aside from skimming through a few chapters)

## WAT

[WAT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) (Web Assembly Text Format) is what allows Web Assembly to be human readable. It's probably not recommended to write an entire app this way. However, it's good to know for the purposes of learning how Web Assembly works behind the scenes and can be a useful tool for debugging.

## Rust

Rust has been voted [Stack Overflow’s most loved language for four years in a row](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019)

At the moment, Rust is probably the best language for writing code for Web Assembly. Mostly that there's a lot of tooling and support. The Rust team is driving a lot of progress in the Web Assembly arena.

Again, most languages have trade offs. For Rust, it seems to be the difficult learning curve.

Rust seems to be the systems and embedded level programming language of the future.

## Why Go?

I chose to do some experimenting with Web Assembly with Go for a few reasons.

1. It's great for enterprise software
2. I know it fairly well.
3. Simple idiomatic opinionated syntax
4. Interesting concurrency patterns
5. Closures (not that other languages don't have closures)

Perhaps more importantly, we use it a lot at work and I was interested in evaluating how viable Go would be for writing Web Assembly modules.

### <a name="Problems-with-Go"></a>Problems with Go

Go is intended for writing software (usually) on servers. One of Go's tradeoffs is that they didn't care a lot about how big the binaries compile to. Therefore, Go binaries are bigger (in comparison to Rust or C). This is because Go runtime is fairly large. Which is nice sometimes, because there are many built-ins in the standard libraries.

### TinyGo

[TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) is a compiler for Go intended for use on microcontrollers. TinyGo now also supports compiling to Web Assembly. It's based on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)

Oh TinyGo, I had some hopes for you, but ultimately the most recent standard Go compiler had better support for Web Assembly out of the box.

However, the binaries were a lot smaller. The TinyGo binaries were only a few kilabytes. Whereas the Go binaries were around 3 to 4 megabytes. (note: 3 to 4 megabytes is fairly large to be shipping over http)

### Concurrency?

With the [breakdown of Moore's law](https://interestingengineering.com/no-more-transistors-the-end-of-moores-law), concurrency will become increasingly important. Transistors won't be getting exponentially smaller, but it's possible that we lean more on parallelism and concurrency models to increase performance in applications.

Some may say that Go's concurrency model is the entire point of Go. Go handles this with the interesting concepts (e.g. [goroutines](https://golangbot.com/goroutines/)(which are "kind of" lightweight threads) and [channels](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines) which are "kind of" similar to [named pipes](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/introduction-pipes-linux) or LIFOs in linux)

So, can you do concurrency with Go in web assembly?

Yes, you can!

## Web Assembly, the Future and Beyond

Web Assembly is an Intermediate Representation. It isn't targeting a specific machine. It's targeting virtual machines which know how to run on specific machines. So, we can run Web Assembly on many types of environments.

### Web Assembly Outside of the Web - WASI

> WASI is a modular system interface for WebAssembly.
> --[wasi.dev](https://wasi.dev/)

WASI allows you to run Web Assembly outside of the web on all different OSs.

> ... it provides a fast, scalable, secure way to run the same code across all machines.
> -- [standardizing wasi](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/)

### The Future

- Being that Web Assembly is more efficient, this could lead to lower battery consumption on mobile devices.
- Small devices like chromebooks have increased useability.
- Javascript libraries will be taking advantage of performance gains by implementing Web Assembly modules behind the scenes
- WASM has a future in serverless [cloudflare workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/webassembly-on-cloudflare-workers/)
- WASM will have a presence on the IOT space
- [Web Assembly roadmap](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/)
