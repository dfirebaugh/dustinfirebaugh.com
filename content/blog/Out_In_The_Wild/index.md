I often say the phrase, "Out in the wild". In fact, it's one of my favorite things to say and I'm pretty sure it confuses people when I say it. I can see why.

Society has its own meaning for the term.

To me, it has several meanings.

## Out in the real world

"Out in the real world" which basically just means, "something I'm observing that's not on the internet".

That might imply that my default state is "plugged in". I suppose that's not entirely wrong. Perhaps eventually I'll have a [brain in jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) scenario and live out my days generously contributing to the internet without having to worry about sustaining my feeble mortality.

## Anthropology

No, not the store...

> Anthropology: the science of human beings especially : the study of human beings and their ancestors through time and space and in relation to physical character, environmental and social relations, and culture
> -- [Meriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropology)

A possibly more acceptable meaning behind this phrase is that I often feel like an outsider looking in on humanity. As if I were a foreign (possibly alien) anthropologist observing human behavior.

A few weeks ago, I was "out in the wild" and I saw a lady throw a shoe at some fella. He may have deserved it.

Last night, "out in the wild", I was at a bar with some friends and noticed a handful of hip youngsters pour into the bar none of which were wearing coats. Concerning because it was 12 degrees F outside with a windchill. I quickly concluded that they must be Canadian.

## In the Trenches

In the trenches could refer to the "out in the wild" of the work-force. For me, it's when I'm in direct combat with the machines. ... because that's my actual job. It's me vs. the computers. As a coder (and techie) -- Some days, I win... some days, the machines win.

"Out in the wild" at one of my old IT support roles. I had a user complaining about a ghost typing on their computer. (I think they were actually convinced that it was a ghost.) Seemingly random text would just magic type onto their screen. I half expected to not be able to observe this issue becuase I assume ghost sightings are rare or something.

Surprisingly enough, I was able to observe strange text "ghost typed" onto the screen. After some initial confusion and disbelief, I realized that he was using a wireless keyboard. Looking around his office. I discovered that the lady that sat directly one floor above him had the same keyboard that was cross talking with his keyboard.

Unfortunately, I was not able to confirm the existence of ghosts.

## Conclusion

I have no right to just go and make up my own meaning for things, but I think I'll keep using this one for my own ammusement.

I hope I run into you "out in the wild" sometime!
